# Development Rule

- **Core Principle**: Think, Evaluate, Apply (TEA). Always evaluate UI fixes using MCP Browser one http://localhost:5273/.  
- **Approach**: Prefer simple, clear, maintainable solutions. Iterate on existing code, avoid scope creep.  
- **Standards**: Follow SOLID, KISS, DRY. Keep public before private, logical flow, readability first.  
- **Workflow**:  
  - TS: unit tests for logic.  
  - TSX: after UI changes, test in MCP Browser → snapshot + DOM check. Once user approves, add Playwright E2E via MCP once user agree yo your changes.
