# Core Development Philosophy

## Fundamental Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions over complex ones
- **Iterate Don't Rebuild**: Prefer iterating on existing working code rather than building from scratch
- **Stay Focused**: Concentrate on the specific task at hand, avoid scope creep
- **Quality Standards**: Use SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles consistently

## Decision Framework

When choosing between solutions:

1. Does it solve the immediate problem simply?
2. Can we build on existing code/patterns?
3. Does it follow established project patterns?

## User Preferences

- Focus on practical, actionable results
- Prefer simple calculations over statistical complexity
- Favor straightforward implementations over advanced algorithms

## Testing Workflow

- **TypeScript (.ts)**: Use unit testing for business logic
- **React Components (.tsx)**: Use Playwright for end-to-end testing
- **Implementation Policy**: Always propose changes first, wait for approval before implementing tests
