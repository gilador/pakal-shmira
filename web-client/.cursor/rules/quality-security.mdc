# Code Quality and Security Standards

## Security Rules

- Never commit `.env` files or hardcode credentials
- Keep sensitive logic server-side
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Be mindful of security implications when adding dependencies

## Code Quality

- Run linting and fix all errors before committing
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for complex business logic only
- Avoid duplication (DRY) - actively look for and reuse existing functionality

## Git and Collaboration

- Make frequent, atomic commits with clear messages
- Keep working directory clean - no unrelated or temporary files
- Don't commit temporary or one-time utility scripts to main codebase
- Use `.gitignore` effectively
- Update relevant documentation when making architectural changes

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

- Fix root causes rather than masking symptoms
- Check console output for errors and warnings after changes
- Add targeted logging for complex issues (remember to check output)
- Research solutions when stuck or unsure

## Environment Management

- Code should work across different environments (dev, test, prod)
- Kill related running servers before starting new ones
- Restart servers after configuration or backend changes
