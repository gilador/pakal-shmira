# TypeScript and React Standards

## TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict typing - avoid `any` type
- Document complex logic with JSDoc
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper type imports: `import type { ... }`

## React Component Standards

- Keep components under 300 lines - refactor proactively
- Break large components into smaller, single-responsibility components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Proper prop typing with interfaces

## File Organization

- Keep files under 300 lines total
- Use clear, descriptive names (avoid "temp", "refactored", "improved")
- Group related functionality together
- Export default for main component, named exports for utilities

## Code Style

- Use consistent formatting and linting
- Prefer `const` over `let` when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow established patterns from the codebase
